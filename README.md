# CurrencyConverter
A simple currency converter app made in C# (WPF). Using exchangerate-api.com for currencies data.
Note: This app does not support all the currencies, it supports a lot of them, but not all. The app was written as a simple home project, of course you can use it, but I do want to state that it is not meant for professional use. You are free to change the code if you likke ;).
